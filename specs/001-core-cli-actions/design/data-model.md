# Data Model: Core CLI and Basic Actions

**Created**: 2025-10-31

## Entities

This feature is focused on command-line parsing and display; it does not introduce any new persistent data entities.

The `ls` command will read existing `fctx-def.conf` files, but the definition and persistence of those configurations are handled by a separate, future feature. Therefore, no data modeling is required for this scope of work.
