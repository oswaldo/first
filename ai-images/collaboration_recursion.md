# Collaboration Recursion

## Context

The user requested a wallpaper illustrating the recursive collaboration between developers and AI assistants to visually support the "Decoupling AI Contexts" tutorial. The concept involves visualizing the "Full Context Swapping" and "Dogfooding" scenarios where AI agents manage their own tools within isolated contexts.

The image depicts a recursive thought process:
- **Left (Human)**: Thinking about the AI, thinking about users (Anne/Bob) and their tools.
- **Right (AI)**: Thinking about the Human, thinking about the AI, thinking about users and their tools.

## Prompt

> A 21:9 ultrawide digital art wallpaper. Bottom center: A human developer (with short wavy hair, glasses and slitghtly unshaved) and a glowing AI avatar collaborating at a futuristic desk. Top Left thought bubble from the human: visualizing the AI avatar, who is visualizing two diverse developers (Anne and Bob) discussing code while thinking about their AI tools (Gemini and Antigravity). Top Right thought bubble from the AI: visualizing the human developer, who is visualizing the AI avatar, who is visualizing the two developers Anne and Bob, who are visualizing their AI assistants. The scene is recursive, meta-cognitive, sleek, dark mode aesthetic, neon accents, high detail, surreal concept art.
