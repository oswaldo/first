# AI Development Disclosure

## Transparency Statement

This project is being developed with extensive use of generative AI assistants, particularly Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude. This disclosure is provided in the spirit of honesty, transparency, and good engineering practice.

## Development Approach

The `first` tool is currently in a **prototype stage** with potential to grow into a production-ready tool. The development workflow leverages AI assistance as a means to:

- **Practice and learn**: Working with AI coding assistants to understand their capabilities and limitations
- **Maintain momentum**: Delivering at least one meaningful changeset per work night despite limited time
- **Iterate quickly**: Rapidly prototyping and testing ideas with AI-generated code as a starting point

## What This Means

### AI-Assisted, Not AI-Generated

While generative AI plays a significant role in this project:

- **Architecture and design decisions** are made by the human maintainer
- **Code review and quality control** are performed by the human maintainer
- **Testing and verification** are conducted to ensure correctness
- **Conceptual direction** follows the philosophy outlined in [`first.md`](first.md)

AI serves as a **productivity multiplier** and **collaborative coding partner**, not a replacement for human judgment and expertise.

### Code Quality Considerations

All AI-generated code is:

- Reviewed for correctness and security
- Tested with the project's test suite
- Linted and formatted according to project standards
- Refactored when necessary to meet quality requirements

### Evolving Practices

As this project matures and if it transitions from prototype to production:

- Development practices will continue to evolve
- Critical components may receive additional human review
- AI assistance levels may be adjusted based on component sensitivity
- This disclosure will be updated to reflect any significant changes in approach

## Questions or Concerns?

If you have questions about the development approach or concerns about using AI-assisted code, please open an issue on the project repository. Feedback and discussion are welcome.

## Legal Status

This disclosure is provided voluntarily as a matter of good practice and transparency. While EU regulations around AI disclosure continue to evolve, we believe in being upfront about our development methodology.
